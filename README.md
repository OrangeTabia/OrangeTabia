## Howdy! ðŸ¤  
My name is Tabia Ye and I am a full stack software engineer. I am a recent graduate of App Academy's 24-week, full-time software engineering program. Before my web development journey, I spent 6 years in athletic adminstration between the youth level and the collegiate level. I am excited to begin my new career as a SWE!
